I"<p>Hello and thank you for visiting my website. After 8 years of staining my clothing with bleach working in a microbiology lab, I decided to follow my passion and learn a thing or two about computer programming.</p>

<p><a href="nathansprojects.com/projects">Projects</a> serves as a showcase for my Data Science work (mainly using R and Python). <a href="nathansprojects.com/notes">Notes</a> serves as a repository of random how-to’s, like fixing bluetooth connectivity on a Garmin watch or creating an image of a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>Like a lab notebook, I record my methods on this website not only for my future reference, but in the hope that my work will be replicated, validated, and expanded on for the benefit of all. However in reality, it was just a few months ago that I learned to <em>print(‘Hello World!’)</em>, so ‘for the benefit of <del>all</del> few’ is more likely ;)</p>

<p>Please send any comments or inquiries to <a href="mailto:mail.nathansprojects@gmail.com">mail.nathansprojects@gmail.com</a></p>
